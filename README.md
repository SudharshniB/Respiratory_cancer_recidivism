TECHNOLOGIES USED:

THE PROJECT IS SOLELY BASED ON PYTHON.

THE PROJECT FOLLOWS A CRISPM-DM FRAMEWORK.

DATA COLLECTED IS BIT MESSY AND HAS MISSING VALUES.

SO FOR OUR ANALYSIS WE HAVE USED ONLY THE VARIABLES WE THINK THAT ARE NECESSARY.

TO CLEAN THE DATA WE HAVE USED KNN - IMPUTATION METHOD.

AND WE HAVE BUILT FIVE MODELS 

1) LOGISTIC REGRESSION
2)RANDOM FOREST
3)XG BOOST
4)LIGHT GBM
5)SVM'S

WE HAVE COMPARED THE FIVE MODELS AND SELECTED THE BEST ONE.
